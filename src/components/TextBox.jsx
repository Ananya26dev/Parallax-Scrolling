      <h3>Parallax Scrolling</h3>
      <p>
        Parallax scrolling in a React.js project involves creating a visual
        effect where background images or elements move at a different speed
        than the foreground content as the user scrolls down the page. This
        technique adds depth and dynamism to the user interface, enhancing the
        visual appeal of the website. Typically, this is achieved using a
        combination of CSS and JavaScript libraries or custom React components
        that adjust the position of elements based on scroll position. The
        effect can be used for backgrounds, images, text, or any other elements
        within a React application.
      </p>
    </div>
